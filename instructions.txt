Solving the Lunar Lander Environment (OpenAI Environment) with Deep Reinforcement Learning:

DLA Project by Riccardo Borgo, David Moe, and Tommaso Grandi.

Files:
1 - requirements.txt to check and eventually install the required dependecies to run the codes
2 - Lunar_Lander_Environment.ipynb: Environment inspection for the Lunar Lander Environments (both dicrete and continuous)
3 - DQN and REINFORCE + Baseline algorithms to solve the discrete version of the Environment, along with py files for netwoks and agents, as well as training and testing notebooks.
4 - DDPG algorithm to solve the continuous version of the Environment, along with py file for netwoks and agent, as well as training and testing notebooks.
