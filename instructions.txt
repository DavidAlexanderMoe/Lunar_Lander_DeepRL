DEPENDENCIES






The exam will involve two steps:
1 The creation of a group project (each group consisting of 2 or 3 members),
which must be submitted via email at least 4 days before the scheduled
exam date in the form of a Python Notebook with commented
instructions and results. Example: solving a Gymnasium environment (e.g.
Pendolum, Atary Pong, etc.) with an RL algorithm seen in the course;
2 An oral examination that will cover both the outcomes of the project
(10/15 minutes presentation, no slides required) and theoretical aspects
related to the course material;
The group members are encouraged to take the exam in the same session
(exceptions are allowed for extraordinary reasons).

Project Code
The submitted project should contain:
a file named training.ipynb in which the training of the agent should be
performed and described;
a file named testing.ipynb in which the trained agent is tested and the
performance are shown;
a file named instructions.txt with the instructions and the requirements to
run the code;
all the required files which are necessary to reproduce the results;
The instructor must be able to completely run both the training.ipynb and
testing.ipynb from scratch.
The project files must be submitted via email at andrea.pozzi@unicatt.it as one of
the following two options:
a .zip folder named LastnameFirstname.zip;
a link to a GitHub repository;
